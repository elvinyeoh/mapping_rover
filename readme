For mapping_rover

# TO VISUALIZE URDF ROVER + ROBOT STATE PUBLISHER 

STEP 1: ros2 launch mapping_rover rsp.launch.py 
STEP 2: cd mapping_rover
STEP 3: rviz2 -d src/config/rviz/view_rover.rviz

# TO VISUALIZE URDF ROVER + ROBOT STATE PUBLISHER + LIDAR OUTPUT

STEP 1: ros2 launch mapping_rover rsp.launch.py 
STEP 2: 
sudo chmod 777 /dev/ttyUSB0
ros2 launch mapping_rover rplidar_s2.launch.py
STEP 3: cd mapping_rover
STEP 4: rviz2 -d src/mapping_rover/config/rviz/view_rover.rviz


# TO LAUNCH MAPPING FUNCTION

STEP 1: ros2 launch mapping_rover rover.launch.py		- Launch bringup (ros2_control, nodes etc.)
STEP 2: ros2 launch mapping_rover rplidar_s2.launch.py		- Launch rplidar
STEP 3:	ros2 launch mapping_rover mapping.launch.py		- Launch slam toolbox (mapper_params_online_async) & Visualize the mapping in RVIZ

Sometimes the laser_scan data will face TF issue, give it a some time to load. If does not work, change the fix_frame to "odom" and laser_scan data will show. Then, change back to fixed frame "map". If any issue, please contact 019-3565401 (Jia-Hao)

# TO SAVE MAP

STEP 1: in rviz, scroll down to SlamToolboxPlugin
STEP 2: Save Map -> insert desired name
STEP 3: click "Save Map"					- Map can be found in home folder (.pgm & .yaml)

Remember to save both "Save Map" and "Serialize Map" - Serialize Map is used by navigation stack 


# TO LAUNCH NAVIGATION STACK

STEP 1: ros2 launch mapping_rover rover.launch.py		- Launch bringup (ros2_control, nodes etc.)
STEP 2: ros2 launch mapping_rover rplidar_s2.launch.py		- Launch rplidar
STEP 3: ros2 launch mapping_rover localization.launch.py                  - start navigation localization (mapper_params_online_async_localization)
STEP 4: cd mapping_rover    - make sure you are in the mapping_rover workspace
STEP 5: ros2 launch nav2_bringup navigation_launch.py use_sim_time:=false params_file:=./src/mapping_rover/config/navigation/nav2_params.yaml     - Launch navigation stack with our nav2_params file


Impotant
STEP 4: is supposed to use ros2 launch mapping_rover navigation.launch.py however it is still in progress

Impotant information - 
Please make sure that the robot pose is correct prior to starting the navigation stack 

Configuration details-
In order to change the map, please proceed to mapper_params_online_async_localization.yaml under "src > config > navigation". 
Change line 22 - map_file_name: "path to serial file" 

Reminder, maps are saved under "src > maps" 

For configuration of navigation2 parameters, please proceed to nav2_params.yaml under "src > config > navigation"
Here, you may change parameters such as layers etc.
